My name is Alcher, a Software Engineer from the Philippines. I'm proficient with Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Go â€” roughly in that order. Most of the contents of this Github account were just throwaway code for prototyping and learning purposes, as I usually use Gitlab to host my (mostly private) projects. Nevertheless, feel free to poke around!

You can read up my thoughts on [my blog](https://alcher.dev/) or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alchermd).
